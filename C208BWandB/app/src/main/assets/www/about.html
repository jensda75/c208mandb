<h4>General info</h4>
<p>
This application is for calculating mass and balance for 
the Cessna Caravan C208B, with cargo pod and payload extender kit installed.<br /><br >
As the application was first intended for a specific company, 
the seat configuration, weights, speeds and special load are all tailored for operation with
that company. However, a standard version, with standards weights and speeds, is developed 
and available on Google Play.<br /><br />
Any comments or suggestions about how to improve the application are welcomed.
</p>

<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
<p>
This application is a third party application, and not an official Cessna 
certified application. It is used purely on the user's own responsibility, 
and only to be used as a supplement to Cessna's official manuals.<br /><br />
